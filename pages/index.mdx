I'm a recent Computer Science and I.T graduate and aspiring Software Engineer.

I like problem-solving, breaking something down to its smallest components and figuring out
what each component does excites me.

I think I would be a great fit in solvTech because I am recent graduate of Computer science and I.T
I am hungry for career growth, and I feel like solvTech is the best option for growing my career in the software development space.
